description: Personnel within Sweden's regions have worked intensively with both sample collection and handling of COVID-19-related samples. A large amount of samples are thereafter sequenced at the National Pandemic Center (NPC), Karolinska Institutet (KI; Stockholm), which also results in an extensive sample collection stored at the NPC. The regions are legally responsible for "their" subset of the sample collection. In theory, the sample collection at NPC is an enormous resource for research.
