inclusion_criteria: "1)\tAge ≥18 years.\n2)\tLaboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or other commercial or public health assay < 7 days prior to screening.\n3)\tSARS-CoV-2 infection with duration at least 7 days  (i e may be included on day 7) as determined by onset of symptoms (defined as day 1).\n4)\t5 liters/minute of Oxygen for at least 8 hours to maintain SpO2 at ≥93%. A shorter duration is also accepted if presentation is acute, and the patient needs more than 10 liters/minute of Oxygen to maintain SpO2 at ≥93%.  \n5)\tCRP > 70 mg/L with no non-SARS-Cov2 infections. Values measured up to 48 hours before inclusion are accepted.\n6)\tFerritin > 500 µg/L. Values measured up to 48 hours before inclusion are accepted.\n7)\tAt least two points on a scale of 0-3 where 1 point is awarded for each value of; lymphocytes < 1x 10(9)/L; D-dimer ≥ 0.5 mg/L and; Lactate Dehydrogenase ≥ 8 microkatal/L. The values do not have to be concurrently positive and may be up to 3 days old at inclusion.\n8)\tAbility to provide informed consent signed by study patient.\n9)\tWillingness and ability to comply with study-related procedures/assessments.\n10)\tIn fertile females, willing to comply with effective contraceptive methods for up to 3 months after last dose of study drug."
exclusion_criteria: "1)\tPregnancy or breast feeding.\n2)\tOngoing or completed mechanical ventilation.\n3)\tIn the opinion of the investigator, unlikely to survive for >48 hours from screening.\n4)\tIn the opinion of the investigator, expected overall survival due to other comorbidities less than 3 months.\n5)\tSevere renal dysfunction eGFR < 30 ml/min.\n6)\tMedical history including chronic liver disease with inflammation, fibrosis or cirrhosis including underlying diseases such as alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, autoimmune liver disease, hemochromatosis, Wilson’s disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, cholangitis, or carcinoma.\n7)\tUncontrolled hypertension Systolic BP >180 mm Hg, Diastolic BP > 110 mm Hg.\n8)\tHistory of hypersensitivity to the study drugs.\n9)\tPresence of any of the following abnormal laboratory values at screening: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 2 x 109/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) greater than 5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), platelets <100 x 109/L.\n10)\tTreatment with anakinra, anti-IL 6, anti-IL-6R antagonists, Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) in the past 30 days or plans to receive during the study period.\n11)\tCurrent treatment with conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)/immunosuppressive agents.\n12)\tUse of chronic oral corticosteroids for a non-COVID-19-related condition in a dose higher than prednisone 10 mg or equivalent per day. Ongoing acute treatment for COVID-19 with any peroral or iv steroid is permitted for up to five days before inclusion. Chronic or acute treatment with inhaled steroids is also permitted.\n13)\tHistory of, or current autoimmune or inflammatory systemic or localized disease(s) other than rheumatoid arthritis.\n14)\tAcute systemic infection; verified by blood cultures systemic bacterial infection, systemic fungi-infection or prosthesis-related infection.\n15)\tHistory of stem-cell or solid organ transplantation.\n16)\tKnown active tuberculosis (TB), history of incompletely treated TB, suspected or known extrapulmonary TB, suspected or known systemic bacterial or fungal infections.\n17)\tDiagnosis of, or suspicion of HIV infection, acute hepatitis A and/or chronic hepatitis B and/or C.\n18)\tPrevious history of gastrointestinal ulceration or diverticulitis. \n19)\tPatients who have received immunosuppressive antibody therapy within the past 3 months, including intravenous immunoglobulin or plans to receive during the study period.\n20)\tParticipation in any clinical research study evaluating an investigational product (IP) or therapy within 3 months and less than 5 half-lives of IP prior to the screening visit. The use of remdesivir is permitted.\n21)\tAny physical examination findings and/or history of any illness that, in the opinion of the study investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose an additional risk to the patient by their participation in the study.
