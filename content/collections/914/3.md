description: The aim of the project is to explore a potential relationship between the digit ratio 2D:4D, as a marker of prenatal testosterone, and severity of COVID-19 infection in men and women. Secondary aims are to investigate steroid, metabolic and immunological profiles in relation to severity of COVID-19. Furthermore, 2D:4D, steroid, metabolic and immunological profiles will be compared with controls. Data on the digit ratio 2D:4D, fasting serum, plasma, whole blood and urine will be collected from 200 men and women after hospitalization for COVID-19 and 200 sex- and age-matched controls.

inclusion_criteria: "Two hundred patients (men and women), age 18-75 years, and treated for COVID-19 at the Karolinska University Hospital will be included in the study. They will be asked to participate in the study after recovery from COVID-19 in connection with discharge from the hospital or at a later follow-up visit.  Two hundred healthy control subjects not experienced symptoms of COVID-19, and matched for sex, age and postcode will be recruited from the background population using SPAR (statliga personadressregistret)."
exclusion_criteria: "Exclusion criteria are: not understanding Swedish and not being willing to participate in the study. If they do not wish to participate in the study, it will not affect their further treatment. The study does not interfere with the diagnosis or course of treatment of patients in any way and does not involve any medical risk."
